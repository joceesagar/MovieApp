# 🎬 MovieApp

MovieApp is a mobile application built with **React Native (using Expo)** that allows users to browse, search, and explore movies using the **TMDb API**. It also uses **Appwrite** as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solution for handling trending analytics, user data, and more. This is my **first React Native project**, through which I learned and implemented key mobile development concepts!
